Hallo,
Omar wrote this short story.
He has no creativity so he doesn't know what to insert.
He realized he is halfway through making a paragraph.
Omar feels guilty that this short story is just a narration.
Omar is happy knowing this is the last line of the paragraph.

Aksel is doesn't really know what to write now that there is no actual story.
However, Aksel likes a change in pace once in a while.
He thinks writing in 3rd person is slightly more challenging.
Aksel is just happy now that he can now git push his edits to the repository.

Alec is very glad to see that he doesn't have to think for this one.
Writing stories is tiring and he thought this was a CS class.
There is a reason he didn't major in English, besides the fact that
we enjoy being able to eat after graduation.

Jackson is also happy that he dosen't have to think much for this one.
He understands the point of the assignment but thought less wirting 
would be done in a CS class.
Jackson has now written what counts ass a paragraph with addition of this sentence.
