Hallo,
Omar wrote this short story.
He has no creativity so he doesn't know what to insert.
He realized he is halfway through making a paragraph.
Omar feels guilty that this short story is just a narration.
Omar is happy knowing this is the last line of the paragraph.

Aksel is doesn't really know what to write now that there is no actual story.
However, Aksel likes a change in pace once in a while.
He thinks writing in 3rd person is slightly more challenging.
Aksel is just happy now that he can now git push his edits to the repository.
